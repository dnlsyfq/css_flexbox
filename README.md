There are two important components to a flexbox layout: 

* flex containers : flex container is an element on a page that contains flex items. 
* flex items : All direct child elements of a flex container are flex items. 

To designate an element as a flex container, set the elementâ€™s display property to flex or inline-flex. Once an item is a flex container, there are several properties we can use to specify how its children behave.
